# camunda-push-to-optimize
Summer HackDays 2020 project: PoC pushing event via pulsar to optimize (instead of Rest import)

## Pulsar

Start from docker-compose.yml. Access:
- [`http://localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088) service bus
- [`http://localhost:8089`](http://localhost:8089) dashboard

## App

Camunda application, Spring Boot based, with simulator generating data and push plugin to send out all relevant history events to Pulsar.

Pulsar connection via Java client, for testing activate profiles
`"consumer, producer"`
to see mocked produce and consume
or just
`"consumer"`
to see the actual events generated by Push Plugin only.

Currently, it sends

* process definition (once after startup)
* process definition diagram (once after startup)
* process instance running
* process instance completed
* activity instance running
* process instance completed
* variable update
* identity link log
